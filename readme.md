<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
The problem that concerns me is <b>one-shot learning</b>.
To be given a single reference and apply pattern recognition to new examples and have the ability to report some measure
of sameness. Humans do this particularly well. If I was to provide you a reference card of an unfamiliar alphabet and
show you a series of hand written variants of that alphabet, chances are you'd be able to match a high percentage of
this test set with the reference alphabet -- perhaps misclassifying a few exotic variations. The current state-of-the-art
for visual pattern recognition are convolutional neural nets. The problem with convolutional neural nets, and with
neural networks to begin with, is that they require massive amounts of labeled data to train on and resources to do so.
I believe there is a better way to approach pattern recognition, a way I'm not sure of the interplay between this method
and traditional methods. Perhaps the view of automata seedlings can be used in conjuction with classical methods in order
to provide a new frounter of machine learning.

<h3>The Importance of One-Shot Learning</h3>
<p>
The ability to find similarity between structures inheirent in their nature bears unprecidented power for computer applications.



Similarity is the foundation of structure and order. For numbers, we can define similarity... sim(a,b) = | a - b |.

The only reason why we can order a list such as <b><i>A</i></b> = [10,3,8,1,7] is because we have a definition of similarity,
which produces structure.
